Jarvis is a simple personal assistant for Linux and MacOS which works on the terminal. He can talk to you if you enable his voice. He can tell you the weather, he can find restaurants and other places near you. He can do some great stuff for you. Stay updated about [new functionalities](NEW_FUNCTIONALITIES.md).

## Getting Started

In order to start Jarvis just clone the repository and run `./setup.sh`

Run **Jarvis** from anywhere by command `jarvis`

On Mac OS X don't forget to activate virtual environment before running jarvis with the command `. env/bin/activate`

You can start by typing `help` within the Jarvis command line to check what Jarvis can do for you.

## How to write new commands (plugins) to extend Jarvis functionality

Create new file custom/hello_world.py

```
from plugin import plugin

@plugin()
def helloworld(jarvis, s):
    """Prints \"hello world!\""""
    jarvis.say("Hello World!")


@plugin()
def repeat(jarvis, s):
    """Repeats what you type"""
    jarvis.say(s)
```

Run jarvis:
```
./jarvis
Jarvis' sound is by default disabled.
In order to let Jarvis talk out loud type: enable sound
Type 'help' for a list of available actions.

~> Hi, what can I do for you?
helloworld
Hello World!
~> What can i do for you?
repeat Jarvis is cool!
